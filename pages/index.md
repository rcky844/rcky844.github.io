# Welcome!
Welcome to Ricky's Garden, a site for hosting information about my work. 👋

> Note
>
> This website is still being updated with more information. It should hopefully be complete before the end of the month (**September 2025**).

I am a 17 years old currently residing in Hong Kong, with a vested interest in programming, biology, chemistry, space exploration, arts and history. I am currently studying in the Bachelor of Nursing programme at the University of Hong Kong. And a lot of whales! 🐳

For any urgent inquiries concerning my work or requests for information, please contact me through my person email address <a href="mailto:rcheung844@gmail.com">rcheung844@gmail.com</a>. 🗨️
