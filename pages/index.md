# Welcome!
Welcome to Ricky's Garden, a site for hosting information about my work. 👋

I am a 16 years old currently residing in Hong Kong, with a vested interest in programming, biology, chemistry, space exploration, arts and history. And a lot of whales! 🐳

This page is currently a stub. It will be left in this state before I complete my HKDSE examination.

For any urgent inquiries concerning my work or requests for information, please contact me through my person email address <a href="mailto:rcheung844@gmail.com">rcheung844@gmail.com</a>. 🗨️

If you wish to buy me a coffee for me to support my work, please head <a href="http://buymeacoffee.com/rcky844">here</a>. ☕
